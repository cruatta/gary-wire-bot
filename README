# Gary

## About
A plug-in based chat bot, written in Scala, for [Wire](https://www.wire.com), a secure, end-to-end encrpyted, messaging service. 

## Status
Currently very **Beta** with interfaces still undergoing changes and issues that need to be fixed.

## Building and Running
Most of the steps for building Gary should be familiar to Scala developers. The Wire specific details can be found in this [readme](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-bot-java/blob/master/README.md)

## Contributing
This is a personal project and unfortunately I have a limited amount of time to maintain Gary. However, if you find a bug please open a PR and I will try to get to it when I can. PR for features and bug fixes are always welcome!
